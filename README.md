# 3D-Computer-Graphics

The following projects were created using OpenGL with Xcode and C++ in OSU’s Introduction to Computer Graphics course.

# Solar System

A 3D Solar System Simulation showing the sun and the eight planets that directly orbit it. The project was completed using a variety of resources such as display lists, transformations, gluLookAt, texture mapping, and lighting.
